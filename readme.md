# Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment

## Overview
 Develop a machine learning model that predicts stock movements by scraping data from social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Telegram. The model should extract insights from user-generated content, such as stock discussions predictions, or sentiment analysis, and accurately forecast stock price trends.


## Features
- **Reddit Data Scraping**: Use `praw` to extract data from Reddit.
- **Data Analysis**: Manipulate and analyze datasets using `pandas` and `numpy`.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Perform text sentiment evaluation with `textblob`.
- **Machine Learning**: Build and evaluate machine learning models with `scikit-learn`.
- **Environment Configuration**: Use `.env` file to securely manage sensitive information like API keys or database credentials.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Ensure `pip` is updated to the latest version:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip

## Installation
- Clone the repository:
    ''' bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
- Install the required libraries:
    ''' bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

- Set up the .env file:
    Create a .env file in the project root directory.
    Add sensitive keys or configuration variables, e.g.
    ''' bash
    CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
    CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
    USER_AGENT=your_user_agent

## Libraries Used
- **praw**: Python Reddit API Wrapper for retrieving Reddit data.
- **requests**: For making HTTP requests (if required).
- **beautifulsoup4**: For parsing and extracting data from HTML (optional).
- **pandas**: For structured data manipulation.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **textblob**: For performing natural language processing tasks.
- **seaborn and matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
